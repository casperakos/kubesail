# KubeSail Features

## Overview
KubeSail is a modern Kubernetes management desktop application built with Tauri 2.0, React, and Rust. It provides a fast, native experience for managing Kubernetes clusters with support for standard resources and service mesh technologies.

## üéØ Core Features

### Resource Management
- **Pods** - View, monitor, and delete pods with real-time status updates
- **Deployments** - Scale deployments, view replica status and availability
- **Services** - Monitor ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer services
- **Namespaces** - Switch between namespaces seamlessly

### Ingress & Traffic Management
- **Ingress Resources** - Full support for:
  - Nginx Ingress Controller
  - Istio Ingress Gateway
  - Traefik
  - Any Kubernetes Ingress resource
- **Visual Indicators**:
  - Ingress class badges (color-coded by controller type)
  - Host routing information
  - TLS/SSL status with shield icon
  - Load balancer addresses
  - Age tracking

### Istio Service Mesh Support
- **VirtualServices**
  - View traffic routing rules
  - See hosts and associated gateways
  - Track routing configurations
- **Gateways**
  - Monitor gateway servers
  - View port, protocol, and host configurations
  - Track ingress/egress gateways

## üî• Key Highlights

### Why Developers Love It
1. **Native Performance** - Built with Rust, not Electron
2. **Small Footprint** - ~10MB binary vs 100MB+ for Electron apps
3. **Real-time Updates** - Auto-refresh every 2-10 seconds
4. **Keyboard-First** - Ready for shortcuts (architecture in place)
5. **Beautiful UI** - Modern design with Tailwind CSS
6. **Type-Safe** - Full TypeScript + Rust type safety

### Ingress Detection
Automatically detects and displays:
- Ingress class (nginx, istio, traefik, etc.)
- Hostname routing
- TLS certificates
- Backend services
- Load balancer IPs

### Service Mesh Integration
Works seamlessly with:
- Istio (VirtualServices, Gateways)
- Gracefully handles clusters without Istio (no errors)

- **Gateways**: Server configurations, ports, protocols

## üöÄ Performance

### Real-time Refresh Intervals
- Pods: 5 seconds
- Deployments: 5 seconds
- Services: 10 seconds
- Ingresses: 10 seconds
- Istio Resources: 10 seconds
- Namespaces: 10 seconds
- Contexts: 30 seconds

### Smart Caching

pnpm run tauri build
```

## üìù Supported Kubernetes Versions
- Works with any Kubernetes 1.19+
- Supports multiple kubeconfig contexts
- Compatible with major cloud providers (GKE, EKS, AKS)
- Works with local clusters (minikube, kind, k3s)
